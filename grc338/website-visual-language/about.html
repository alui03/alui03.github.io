                <p>We believe in a high-quality tea with a high-quality brew. No powdered creamers. No high fructose corn syrups. Simply premium, loose-leaf tea sourced from the highest quality tea vendors in the world.
                </p>

                <p>Traditional hot brewing can be a harsh process that rapidly extracts out natural tannins in the leaves if even slightly over-steeped.</p>

                <p>We believe cold brew tea is the balance boba tea was made for. Sequel is spearheading the market for a drink that is refreshing, yet refined — health beneficial, yet elevated. At Sequel, we are continuing a story that already exists, just a little different than before.</p>

                <p>It was 3AM in the summer of 2020 when the idea of cold brew boba tea jolted Justin out of bed. He scoured the internet for every Google Scholar article published on cold brew extraction over the past 20 years. Justin experimented with samples from 3 different tea vendors—tested dozens of different varieties of black, green, and oolong teas, and proceeded to spend the rest of the summer in the kitchen.
                </p>

                <p>Not all tea leaves have the same cold brew diffusion rates. Everything from the leaf variety, oxidation level, roasting process, and/or floral add-ins all affect the diffusion time in maximizing the extraction of aromatic nuances within the tea. After multiple week-long trials and months of progress, Justin settled on the right leaf, the right time, and the right flavor profile to find the balance that we all crave.</p>

                <p>With Sequel, Justin wanted to not only highlight his cold brew boba tea, but also wished to provide a place for people to come together and be a part of each other’s stories.</p>
